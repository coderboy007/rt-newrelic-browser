This plugin helps you to create a New Relic Browser application.

== Description ==
New Relic Browser provides deep visibility and actionable insights into real users experiences on your website. 
With standard page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM), New Relic measures the overall time to load the entire webpage.
However, New Relic Browser goes beyond RUM to also help you monitor the performance of individual sessions, AJAX requests, and JavaScript errorsâ€”extending the monitoring throughout the entire life cycle of the page.

This plugin will allow you to integrate your New Relic Browser app with your website. 

If you do not have a New Relic account, then just select "No" and provide the required details. 

If you already have a New Relic account, then just select "Yes" and provide your account API key.

Hit "Submit" and the New Relic script will be loaded automatically in <head> tag of your site without any manual effort.

* Allows you to create New Relic Account and Browser App a real quick.
* If you already have New Relic Account the you just have to provide API key of your account and then it will give you options to select existing browser app(if you have any) OR crate a new browser app.
* You do not need to edit your theme's header file manually to copy the New Relic javascript manually. The plugin does this on the fly.
* Compatible with WordPress Multisite.
* Throughly tested on top 10 WordPress opensource themes and plugins in WordPress themes/plugins repo.
