This plugin helps you to create a New Relic Browser application.

== Description ==
New Relic Browser provides deep visibility and actionable insights into real users experiences on your website. 
With standard page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM), New Relic measures the overall time to load the entire webpage.
However, New Relic Browser goes beyond RUM to also help you monitor the performance of individual sessions, AJAX requests, and JavaScript errorsâ€”extending the monitoring throughout the entire life cycle of the page.

This plugin will allow you to integrate your New Relic Browser app with your website. If you do not have New Relic account, then just select "No" and provide required details. The New Relic script will be loaded automatically in <head> tag of your site without any manual effort.

== Installation ==
Install \"New Relic Browser\" either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.

Activate \"New Relic Browser\" in the \"Plugins\" admin panel using the \"Activate\" link. If you\'re using WordPress Multisite, you can choose to activate \"New Relic Browser\" network wide for full integration with all of your site.
